## Description
This is a simple app allowing instructors to sign up a school, create lessons, and schedule events on their google calendar for said lessons. From there they are able to create students, grade them, and include them in events scheduled. 

For future implementations, I plan on adding more styling and dynamic pages so that when lessons, events, or schools are created, they are added to the page without having to load. There will also be more functionality added in for the grading of the students progress, allowing for custom grading based upon the lessons they attend, and analytics determined from the grades given to the students. Another future iteration to add, is a RESTful API, that can be used in fetch calls through javascript, so that the pages are more dynamic.
* This project is currently under construction.
